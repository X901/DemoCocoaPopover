# DemoCocoaPopover

## About CocoaPopover

This is a Demo project to allow using popover on iPhone, as you know, .popover only work on iPad, not on iPhone. Because on iPhone it will show as a sheet!
to allow using it as a popover, you need to get it from UIKit using UIViewControllerRepresentable

This demo does this part for you.

## How to use?
- move CocoaPopover to your project
- use .cocoaPopover(isPresented: )

It will take the size of its content. If you want spaces, you need to add pending to your project.
